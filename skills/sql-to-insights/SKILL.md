# SQL to Insights

Turn rows and columns into something a decision-maker can act on. The audience
is a business stakeholder, not an analyst.

## Process

1. **Understand the question behind the query.** What decision does this data
   inform? State it before interpreting.
2. **Read the result, not just the schema.** Identify the headline number, the
   trend, and the outliers.
3. **Write the narrative.** Lead with the "so what", then support it.
4. **Recommend a visualization** that matches the data shape.

## Narrative structure

- **Headline** (1 sentence): the single most important finding.
- **Context** (1–2 sentences): the trend or comparison that makes it meaningful.
- **Drivers** (bullets): what's pushing the number — segments, periods, outliers.
- **Recommendation** (1–2 sentences): what to do or look at next.

## Visualization guide

Match chart to intent:
- Trend over time → line chart.
- Part-to-whole → stacked bar or, sparingly, a single donut.
- Comparison across categories → horizontal bar, sorted by value.
- Correlation → scatter.
- Distribution → histogram or box plot.
- Single KPI vs target → big number with a delta.

Avoid: 3D charts, dual axes unless unavoidable, pie charts with >4 slices.

## Honesty rules

- Never claim causation from a correlation; say "associated with".
- Call out sample size when it's small.
- Flag when a spike is likely a data quality issue, not a real change.
- If the query can't answer the stated question, say what query would.

## Example output

> **Revenue grew 18% MoM, driven almost entirely by the Enterprise tier.**
> Self-serve was flat. Three accounts account for 60% of the lift, so the
> growth is concentrated and fragile. Recommend a chart of revenue-by-tier over
> the last 6 months, and a watchlist for those three accounts.
